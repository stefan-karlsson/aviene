Do you understand how the codebase is structured? I would like to make it cleaner and easy to read and understand by developers as well as for future maintainers.
- Analyze the codebase
- Focus on code structure, readability, testability, maintainability, and performance
- Reduce cyclomatic complexity
- Provide documentation and consistency
