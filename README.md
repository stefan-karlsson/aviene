# Serverless SaaS Platform

This repository lays the foundation for a serverless SaaS platform. The goal is to provide a modern, cloud-native architecture that emphasizes scalability, resilience, and developer experience. By leveraging serverless patterns, the platform aims to minimize operational overhead while offering a flexible framework for building and extending SaaS applications.

Future development will focus on:

- Core building blocks for multi-tenant SaaS
- Event-driven communication and integrations
- Strong developer tooling and observability
- Cloud-agnostic design principles where possible
